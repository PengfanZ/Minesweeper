# Minesweeper
Mine Sweeper Manual:
This program basically is similar to the original mine sweeper game. There are 15×15 grey grids, and 40 mines are hidden randomly inside the grid. 

The user need to click the left button of the mouse to reveal the grid. If the revealed grid turns white and there is no number on it, this will represent that there are no mines in adjacent squares. If there is number on the revealed grid, the value of the number will tell you the number of mines hidden in the surrounding squares. If you click the mine, then the whole screen will turn red—game over.

The user can click the right button of the mouse to mark the mine. The clicked grid will turn red if you successfully mark the mine. Otherwise, the whole screen will turn yellow—game over.

If every grid is revealed properly, the user will win the game.
